**WARM WOODY KNOCKER** is an Arduino based metronome that uses solenoids beating a wooden box to produce sound.

## Features

* Wide range of tempos.

* Linear rhytms. Meter and subdivision are both configurable, so anything between 1/4 and 16/16 is possible.

* Irregular patterns like Clave, Songo or Saiidi. Swing rhytms can be simulated in this mode as well. Patterns of arbitrary length and subdivision are supported. Two "tracks" (each controlling it's own actuator) with three sound levels each (off / regular / accented) are available while programming a pattern. (TODO: wiki page)

* Volume adjustment (TODO: wiki page). Level range is quite wide in theory, but not the whole range gives stable result, because of mechanics instability.
